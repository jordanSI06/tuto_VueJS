Chapter 1:

normally v-bind: but v-bind not necessary

on the console we can modify element with writting the var and the content:
exemple: app.message="ok";

to push in todo list: app4.todos.push( { text: 'maitriser'})

v-model: to apply a function or a variable in function of the input.

Chapter 2:

mounted and destroy instance are very important!! mounted will turn on a function before 
the element will be mounted (ex: we order to the element to be incremented each second,
when the element is mounted, the function is applied, and we need to destroy it later when we don't need it anymore.
